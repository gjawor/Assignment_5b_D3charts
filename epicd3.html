    Even though the Boston harbor has existed and been in use for a long time, no one
    was ever cleaning it. The pollution buildup caused extreme damage to the waterways
    and local ecosystem. In 1972 the Clean Water Act passed which helped motivate a
    cleanup project for the harbor. While the cost to clean up these polluted spaces
    is very expensive, estimated at 4.7 billion dollars, the return and benefit from
    the ecosystem justifies the cost. This study explores monetary values for the
    ecosystem, as well as the impact that the clean up has had so far. Restoring and
    maintaining the local ecosystem is important for the many organisms its home to,
    and also helps raise the value of the land which is between 30 - 100 billion.
